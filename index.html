Affair
¯¯¯¯¯¯<p>As a young man I fell in love with a harpist.

The affair lasted no longer than the ninety or so seconds it took her to trundle
her harp across the Standford quadrangle,  at dusk, on a perfect day.  In formal
gown, her hair braided and flaxen, she floated. And was gone.

But the oxytocin receptors had locked on and bestowed upon her such virtues! She
wouldn't give me a hard time; she would love and admire me and, in the evenings,
after a single meal,  the  kids happy and asleep,  she would softly play her sad
harp as I toyed with a mathematical expression or two.

Years later  it occurred to me to wonder what "life" would have been like with a
person who had devoted  her life  to a strictly diatonic instrument:  no bending
of the notes;  no wailing:  plinky plonky, plinky plonk.  And my wicked thoughts
turned to electric guitaristes.

I am not a nice man.

Bedtime Story
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯<p>The three hundred thousand tonne ocean-going freight-liner "Jolly Jim" is
ploughing its way through the heavy swell of the North Atlantic. The massive
ship is about the length of a street and taller than any of the houses in it.
[discuss].

Owing to an administrative error in the shipping office. In contravention of
maritime regulation DC186 (toxic cargo act 1965), a crate of large hadrons on
its way to Switzerland, and a crate of warm, dark neutrinos bound for Mexico,
have been stored on the same deck.

For a while all goes well.

But suddenly, after a particularly high wave, the webbing on the hadrons crate
snaps and it skids across the decking and smashes into the crate of neutrinos.
[discuss what might happen next].

Of course, the large hadrons and the neutrinos react to produce a three hundred
million kilogram anti-gravity field with an effective half-radius of five hund-
red metres [explain this] and the Jolly Jim lifts gently into the night sky,

At once the pitching and rolling abates [everyone happy with "abates"?] as the
freighter drifts majestically upwards.

Now two things happen at the same time:

1) The captain dispatches a rescue party, shod in magnetic-soled boots, to
   separate and re-secure the two crates on the cargo deck.

2) A gentle westerly breeze catches the vast ship, which slowly starts to drift
   towards England [pause for reflection and suggestion] at an altitude of five
   thousand metres.

As night falls, the ship passes over [relative's town], where an old couple,
looking out of the window notices the silhouette of a ship passing slowly across
the moon.

Later on in [another relative's town][rel2a] and [rel2b] notice the same thing
and wonder where the ghostly ship is heading.

Around midnight the ship arrives at [child's home town] and minutes later, a
vast shadow falls over [child's street] blocking out the stars. By coincidence,
at exactly the same time, the cargo-deck rescue crew manage to separate the
crates and push them to opposite ends of the deck.

Slowly at first, but then with increasing speed, the large ship hurtles down-
wards towards the roof of number [child's house number].

That's enough for tonight, we'll carry on tomorrow. Sleep well.

Taps the headline with his knife: POPE: I'M GAY!
"Huh!? Huh!?"

The Daves agree: "Huh!"

Emboldened, one of the Daves thinks he'll have a go: MORE MONEY FOR THE RICH!
"Huh!?"

Pause while Dave considers whether this qualifies ...
Finally, "Huh!"

General relief and bonhomie. Another round of teas.

No 2: Bag Lady
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯<p>She wears a black jacket over a floral print frock of a length  not  fashionable
this side of the Great War. She is slightly on the large side of comfortable and
is wearing lipstick mostly on her lips and teeth.  She cannot manage the complex
social interaction that starts "Good afternoon:" but she does want the  checkout
lady to reassure her about the genetic modification status of her small  box  of
Persil.  Her relationship with reality seems to be that of a respectful observer
rather than participant.  With the exception of four  separate  unbagged  stalks
sticker, which must be painstakingly removed before the item can be scanned. She
attempts to pay from a small wad of tokens and newspaper cuttings many of  which
have a connection with the retail trade, and some even with Tesco.  She makes up
back and forth between her purse and checkout lady's patient hand.  Finally, she
stows nearly all  of her shopping in the ragged carrier bag she has brought with 
her, and sails from the store.

Cherish her; she is diversity.</p>
No 4: Hands-on Father
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯<p>James and Toby have discovered they receive attention  by  asking  their  father
interesting questions about each item as they hand it to him from the blue  eco-
basket.  He is aware of this and has come to choose items for their prestige and
conversational value more than for any intrinsic worth.  He shops  alone  during
his office lunch hour for his athlete's foot cream.  What is important about his
careful replies is not that his sons learn something,  but  that everyone in the
queues either side of his own hears what a good father he is, and how bright are
his children.   What Malcolm fails to realise is that nobody gives a fuck except
that they find the whole show slightly sickening.

Give him a wide berth.</p>
No 7: Earth Mother
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯<p>She stands with her mighty arms folded while someone goes to  replace  the  Mini
Chocolate Bar Family Pack, which was found to contain teeth marks.  She looks on
benignly as her three hyperactive bullet-headed sons Wayne, Duane and Shane tear
around accidentally hurting people.  Unlike me,  she is in no  particular hurry,
and when the replacement arrives, she packs all of her shopping  carefully  into
the trolley  before finding her purse.  She is at the top of the food chain, has
no predators, and fears no-one.

Avoid eye contact.

Design
¯¯¯¯¯¯<p>A: You asked to see us O beloved and beneficent leader?
L: Yes, I have been trying my hand at this programming malarkey. I have produced
   a most beautiful and elegant program but it says SYNTAX ERROR.
A: Don't worry Divine One, we will immediately change the definition of the
   language so that your most excellent and correct program will work and be of
   great comfort and inspiration to your loving people. Forgive us O wonderful-
   ness.
L: Well make it snappy. I fancy having a crack at assembler programming next, so
   tell the chip manufacturers to stand by in case they need to correct some
   errors in their instruction set.

B: You asked to see us O beloved and beneficent leader?
L: Yes, I have mastered this high precision optical microscope, which you have
   provided. I am now an expert in its use and can see all manner of small stuff
   by looking through the thin end.
B: His wonderfulness is indeed a virtuoso of this delicate precision instrument.
L: One thing. I'm finding it awkward when I use it to bang in nails or take the
   tops off beer bottles. Do you think this is a deficiency in your design?
B: How astute of his deliciousness to identify this flaw. We will change the
   design immediately to include a beverage opener and various hammer attach-
   ments.
L: On your way out, send in the scales guys. All these fiddly little levers and
   whatnot on their chemical balance get in the way when I'm swinging it round
   my head to bring down wallaby during the hunt.

Drudge
------<p>"Instruction tables will have to be made up by mathematicians with computing ex-
 perience and perhaps a certain puzzle-solving ability.  There  need  be no real
 danger of it ever becoming a drudge, for any processes that are quite mechanic-
 al may be turned over to the machine itself."

atory, Teddington; published in A.M.Turing's ACE Report of 1946 and Other Papers
(1986), edited by B.E.Carpenter and R. W. Doran, and in the Collected Works of

Elocution
---------<p>
I must have adopted the local Warwickshire (Oy ain't gunner doo 'aht) accent for
reasons of fitting in and safety.  My parents assumed I would  prefer  to  speak
more like Prince Charles if only I had the knack and  so  "suggested"  I  attend
elocution lessons.  There were conducted by Miss Pauline Wattis, local thespian,
at the school on Wednesday lunchtimes.  A serious inconvenience  but  there  was
no way out.

My strategy in such situations is to position myself,  both  geographically  and
intellectually,  two  thirds  of  the  way back, as any more or any less invites
special attention.  Unfortunately, Miss Wattis had  only four customers, so that
didn't work.

I have no recollection of the actual sessions. Attention must have been drawn to
missing  consonants  and attempts made to separate and re-assign most of my vow-
als.
(
    The Warwickshire short u, here written u, is a magnificent  beast.  It lurks
    near the fr∪nt of the mouth,  waiting  to  m∪g any likely-l∪kking words that
    pass by. G∪d l∪ck reading that b∪k, D∪ck. My father praised treacle-strength
    tea as being a G∪d C∪p  and I take pride in knowing that William Shakespeare
    m∪st have said: Bl∪d will have bl∪d.
)
Inevitably, The Head, keen to show off a progressive school, requires  a  demon-
stration of our skills at speech day.  There was no escape from this horror so I
controlled my fear simply by pretending to myself that it would not happen.

Come the night,  we were compelled on stage  by nothing more tangible than coll-
ective expectation.  Each of us tried unsuccessfully to stand behind the others.
We should have fled but could not  (cue grainy footage of the  compliant victims
of pogrom).  Before us, somewhere in the dark sea of critical faces.  there must
have been exactly two encouraging smiles per speaker.  But mine.  lifebelts in a
heavy swell, were lost to me.

Afraid and close to tears, we mumbled our way inaudibly through all four verses.
all twenty-four lines, of G. K. Chesterton's cheerful poem: "The Rolling English
Road" [Google it].

And left the stage.

Not only had we let ourselves down; we had let down Miss Wattis, the Headmaster,
our families, and the school.
